 * common reasoning/thinking text prefixes (including lowercased and Markdown
 * blockquoted forms). Heartbeat reasoning is delivered separately and only when
 * `includeReasoning` is enabled; without this guard a trailing reasoning
 * payload (which reasoning models can emit after the final answer) would be
 * selected as the user-visible heartbeat reply.
