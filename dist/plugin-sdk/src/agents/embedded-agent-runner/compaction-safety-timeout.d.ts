 * Invoke a plugin-owned {@link ContextEngine.compact} bounded by the same
 * finite safety timeout that protects native runtime compaction.
 *
 * Plugin context engines that advertise `ownsCompaction` previously had their
 * `compact()` awaited with no timeout, no watchdog, and no abort signal — a
 * slow or hung plugin compaction would hang the agent turn indefinitely. This
 * wrapper closes that gap:
 *  - the call is bounded by `timeoutMs` (host-resolved, default
 *    {@link EMBEDDED_COMPACTION_TIMEOUT_MS}); on timeout it rejects with a
 *    "Compaction timed out" error so the caller's existing failure handling
 *    runs instead of hanging;
 *  - the timeout signal and caller `abortSignal` are both raced against the
 *    call (so a non-cooperating engine is still bounded) and threaded into the
 *    `compact()` params (so cooperating engines can cancel their own in-flight
 *    work).
 *
 * Callers keep their existing try/catch — a timeout or abort surfaces as a
 * thrown error, never a silent hang.
